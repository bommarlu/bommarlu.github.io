## Who am I?

Hi, I'm Luca. I attended high school at Los Gatos High School in [Los Gatos, California](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Los+Gatos,+CA/@37.2334516,-122.0339357,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x808e34365377033f:0xef675301ac748ca6!8m2!3d37.2358078!4d-121.9623751!16zL20vMG1oZHo?entry=ttu). Four years later, I graduated Summa Cum Laude in Computer Science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. *Go Blue!* I am passionate about running, machine learning, and electronic music.
